/// The xplatform library is a platform library with the following goals:
/// * Work with high-level operating systems (Windows, Linux, BSD, OSX, QNX, etc)
/// * Work with real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS, ThreadX, ucOS, etc)
/// * Provide standard operating system primitives
/// * Provide standard hardware interfaces
/// * Hide the platform-specifics from the developer
